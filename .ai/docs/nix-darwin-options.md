nix-darwin Configuration Options
Version 26.05.da529ac

\_module.args

    Additional arguments passed to each module in addition to ones like lib, config, and pkgs, modulesPath.

    This option is also available to all submodules. Submodules do not inherit args from their parent module, nor do they provide args to their parent module or sibling submodules. The sole exception to this is the argument name which is provided by parent modules to a submodule and contains the attribute name the submodule is bound to, or a unique generated name if it is not bound to an attribute.

    Some arguments are already passed by default, of which the following cannot be changed with this option:

        lib: The nixpkgs library.

        config: The results of all options after merging the values from all modules together.

        options: The options declared in all modules.

        specialArgs: The specialArgs argument passed to evalModules.

        All attributes of specialArgs

        Whereas option values can generally depend on other option values thanks to laziness, this does not apply to imports, which must be computed statically before anything else.

        For this reason, callers of the module system can provide specialArgs which are available during import resolution.

        For NixOS, specialArgs includes modulesPath, which allows you to import extra modules from the nixpkgs package tree without having to somehow make the module aware of the location of the nixpkgs or NixOS directories.

        { modulesPath, ... }: {
          imports = [
            (modulesPath + "/profiles/minimal.nix")
          ];
        }

    For NixOS, the default value for this option includes at least this argument:

        pkgs: The nixpkgs package set according to the nixpkgs.pkgs option.

    Type: lazy attribute set of raw value

    Declared by:
    <nixpkgs/lib/modules.nix>

documentation.enable

    Whether to install documentation of packages from environment.systemPackages into the generated system path.

    See “Multiple-output packages” chapter in the nixpkgs manual for more info.

    Type: boolean

    Default: true

    Declared by:

environment.darwinConfig

    The path of the darwin configuration.nix used to configure the system, this updates the default darwin-config entry in NIX_PATH. Since this changes an environment variable it will only apply to new shells.

    NOTE: Changing this requires running darwin-rebuild switch -I darwin-config=/path/to/configuration.nix the first time to make darwin-rebuild aware of the custom location.

    Type: null or absolute path or string

    Default:

    if config.nixpkgs.flake.setNixPath then
      # Don’t set this for flake‐based systems.
      null
    else if config.system.stateVersion >= 6 then
      "/etc/nix-darwin/configuration.nix"
    else

homebrew.enable

    Whether to enable nix-darwin to manage installing/updating/upgrading Homebrew taps, formulae, casks, Mac App Store apps, Visual Studio Code extensions, Go packages, and Cargo crates using Homebrew Bundle.

    Note that enabling this option does not install Homebrew, see the Homebrew website for installation instructions.

    Use the homebrew.brews, homebrew.casks, homebrew.masApps, homebrew.vscode, homebrew.goPackages, and homebrew.cargoPackages options to list the Homebrew formulae, casks, Mac App Store apps, Visual Studio Code extensions, Go packages, and Cargo crates you’d like to install. Use the homebrew.taps option, to make additional formula repositories available to Homebrew. This module uses those options (along with the homebrew.caskArgs options) to generate a Brewfile that nix-darwin passes to the brew bundle command during system activation.

    The default configuration of this module prevents Homebrew Bundle from auto-updating Homebrew and all formulae, as well as upgrading anything that’s already installed, so that repeated invocations of darwin-rebuild switch (without any change to the configuration) are idempotent. You can modify this behavior using the options under homebrew.onActivation.

    This module also provides a few options for modifying how Homebrew commands behave when you manually invoke them, under homebrew.global.

    Type: boolean

    Default: false

    Example: true

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.brews.\*.restart_service

    Whether to run brew services restart for the formula and register it to launch at login (or boot).

homebrew.casks.\*.args

    Arguments passed to brew install --cask when installing this cask. See homebrew.caskArgs for the available options.

    Type: null or (submodule)

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.casks.\*.greedy

    Whether to always upgrade this cask regardless of whether it’s unversioned or it updates itself.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.casks.\*.name

    The name of the cask to install.

    Type: string

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.casks.\*.postinstall

    A shell command to run after the cask is installed or upgraded. The command is passed to the system shell and only executes when the cask was actually installed or upgraded, not on every brew bundle run.

    Type: null or string

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.extraConfig

    Extra lines to be added verbatim to the bottom of the generated Brewfile.

    Type: strings concatenated with “\n”

homebrew.global

    Options for configuring the behavior of Homebrew commands when you manually invoke them.

    Type: submodule

    Default: { }

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.global.autoUpdate

    Whether to enable Homebrew to auto-update itself and all formulae when you manually invoke commands like brew install, brew upgrade, brew tap, and brew bundle [install].

    Note that Homebrew auto-updates when you manually invoke commands like the ones mentioned above if it’s been more than 5 minutes since it last updated.

    You may want to consider disabling this option if you have homebrew.onActivation.upgrade enabled, and homebrew.onActivation.autoUpdate disabled, if you want to ensure that your installed formulae will only be upgraded during nix-darwin system activation, after you’ve explicitly run brew update.

    Implementation note: when disabled, this option sets the HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE environment variable, by adding it to environment.variables.

    Type: boolean

    Default: true

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.global.brewfile

    Whether to enable Homebrew to automatically use the Brewfile that this module generates in the Nix store, when you manually invoke brew bundle.

    Implementation note: when enabled, this option sets the HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_FILE environment variable to the path of the Brewfile that this module generates in the Nix store, by adding it to environment.variables.

    Type: boolean

    Default: false

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.goPackages

    List of Go packages to install using go install.

    Homebrew will automatically install the go formula if it is not already installed.

    Type: list of string

    Default: [ ]

    Example:

    [
      "github.com/charmbracelet/crush"
    ]

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.greedyCasks

    Whether to always upgrade casks listed in homebrew.casks regardless of whether it’s unversioned or it updates itself.

    Homebrew’s default is false.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.masApps

    Applications to install from Mac App Store using mas.

    Note that you need to be signed into the Mac App Store for mas to successfully install and upgrade applications, and that unfortunately apps removed from this option will not be uninstalled automatically even if homebrew.onActivation.cleanup is set to "uninstall" or "zap" (this is currently a limitation of Homebrew Bundle).

    For more information on mas see: github.com/mas-cli/mas.

    Type: attribute set of (positive integer, meaning >0)

    Default: { }

    Example:

    {
      "1Password for Safari" = 1569813296;
      Xcode = 497799835;
    }

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.onActivation

    Options for configuring the behavior of the brew bundle command that nix-darwin runs during system activation.

    Type: submodule

    Default: { }

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.onActivation.autoUpdate

    Whether to enable Homebrew to auto-update itself and all formulae during nix-darwin system activation. The default is false so that repeated invocations of darwin-rebuild switch are idempotent.

    Note that Homebrew auto-updates when it’s been more than 5 minutes since it last updated.

    Although auto-updating is disabled by default during system activation, note that Homebrew will auto-update when you manually invoke certain Homebrew commands. To modify this behavior see homebrew.global.autoUpdate.

    Implementation note: when disabled, this option sets the HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE environment variable when nix-darwin invokes brew bundle [install] during system activation.

    Type: boolean

    Default: false

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.onActivation.cleanup

    This option manages what happens to packages installed by Homebrew that aren’t present in the Brewfile generated by this module, during nix-darwin system activation.

    When set to "none" (the default), packages not present in the generated Brewfile are left installed.

    When set to "check", nix-darwin verifies during system activation that no Homebrew packages (taps, formulae, casks, etc.) are installed that aren’t present in the generated Brewfile. If extra packages are found, activation fails with a list of them. Note that when this check fails during darwin-rebuild switch, the entire system activation is aborted and no other configuration changes will be applied until the issue is resolved.

    When set to "uninstall", nix-darwin invokes brew bundle [install] with the --cleanup flag. This uninstalls all packages not listed in the generated Brewfile, i.e., brew uninstall is run for those packages.

    When set to "zap", nix-darwin invokes brew bundle [install] with the --cleanup --zap flags. This uninstalls all packages not listed in the generated Brewfile, and if the package is a cask, removes all files associated with that cask. In other words, brew uninstall --zap is run for all those packages.

    If you plan on exclusively using nix-darwin to manage packages installed by Homebrew, you probably want to set this option to "uninstall" or "zap".

    Type: one of “none”, “check”, “uninstall”, “zap”

    Default: "none"

    Example: "uninstall"

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.onActivation.extraFlags

    Extra flags to pass to brew bundle [install] during nix-darwin system activation.

    Type: list of string

    Default: [ ]

    Example:

    [
      "--verbose"
    ]

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.onActivation.upgrade

    Whether to enable Homebrew to upgrade outdated formulae and Mac App Store apps during nix-darwin system activation. The default is false so that repeated invocations of darwin-rebuild switch are idempotent.

    Implementation note: when disabled, nix-darwin invokes brew bundle [install] with the --no-upgrade flag during system activation.

    Type: boolean

    Default: false

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.prefix

    The Homebrew prefix directory, i.e., the value that brew --prefix returns. The default is automatically set based on your system’s platform, and should only need to be changed if you manually installed Homebrew in a non-standard location.

    Type: string

    Default:

    if pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform.isAarch64 then "/opt/homebrew"
    else "/usr/local"

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.taps

    List of Homebrew formula repositories to tap.

    Taps defined as strings, e.g., "user/repo", are a shorthand for:

    { name = "user/repo"; }

    Type: list of ((submodule) or string convertible to it)

    Default: [ ]

    Example:

    # Adapted from https://docs.brew.sh/Brew-Bundle-and-Brewfile
    [
      # `brew tap`
      "apple/apple"

      # `brew tap` with custom Git URL and arguments

        clone_target = "https://user@bitbucket.org/user/homebrew-tap-repo.git";
        force_auto_update = true;
      }
    ]

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.taps.\*.clone_target

    Use this option to tap a formula repository from anywhere, using any transport protocol that git handles. When clone_target is specified, taps can be cloned from places other than GitHub and using protocols other than HTTPS, e.g., SSH, git, HTTP, FTP(S), rsync.

    Type: null or string

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.taps.\*.force_auto_update

    Whether to auto-update the tap even if it is not hosted on GitHub. By default, only taps hosted on GitHub are auto-updated (for performance reasons).

    Note: Homebrew Bundle accepts this option in Brewfile syntax but may silently ignore it during installation. See the Homebrew Bundle source for current behavior.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.taps.\*.name

    When clone_target is unspecified, this is the name of a formula repository to tap from GitHub using HTTPS. For example, "user/repo" will tap https://github.com/user/homebrew-repo.

    Type: string

    Example: "apple/apple"

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.user

    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

homebrew.vscode

    List of Visual Studio Code extensions to install using Homebrew Bundle.

    A compatible editor (Visual Studio Code, VSCodium, Cursor, or VS Code Insiders) must be available. If none is found, Homebrew will attempt to install visual-studio-code automatically.

    For more information on code see: VSCode Extension Marketplace.

    Type: list of string

    Default: [ ]

    Example:

    [
      "golang.go"
    ]

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/homebrew.nix>

launchd.agents

    Definition of per-user launchd agents.

    When a user logs in, a per-user launchd is started. It does the following:

        It loads the parameters for each launch-on-demand user agent from the property list files found in /System/Library/LaunchAgents, /Library/LaunchAgents, and the user’s individual Library/LaunchAgents directory.

        It registers the sockets and file descriptors requested by those user agents.

        It launches any user agents that requested to be running all the time.

        As requests for a particular service arrive, it launches the corresponding user agent and passes the request to it.


    Type: attribute set of (submodule)

    Default: { }

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.command

    Command executed as the service’s main process.

    Type: string or absolute path

    Default: ""

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.environment

    Environment variables passed to the service’s processes.

    Type: attribute set of (string or list of string)

      LANG = "nl_NL.UTF-8";
      PATH = "/foo/bar/bin";
    }

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.path

    Packages added to the service’s PATH environment variable. Only the bin and subdirectories of each package is added.

    Type: list of (absolute path or string)

    Default: [ ]

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.script

    Shell commands executed as the service’s main process.

    Type: strings concatenated with “\n”

    Default: ""

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig

    Each attribute in this set specifies an option for a key in the plist. https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/launchd.plist.5.html

    Type: submodule

    Default: { }

    Example:

    {
      KeepAlive = true;
      Program = "/run/current-system/sw/bin/nix-daemon";
    }

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.AbandonProcessGroup

    When a job dies, launchd kills any remaining processes with the same process group ID as the job. Setting this key to true disables that behavior.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Debug

    This optional key specifies that launchd should adjust its log mask temporarily to LOG_DEBUG while dealing with this job.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Disabled

    This optional key is used as a hint to launchctl(1) that it should not submit this job to launchd when loading a job or jobs. The value of this key does NOT reflect the current state of the job on the running system. If you wish to know whether a job is loaded in launchd, reading this key from a configuration file yourself is not a sufficient test. You should query launchd for the presence of the job using the launchctl(1) list subcommand or use the ServiceManagement framework’s SMJobCopyDictionary() method.

    Note that as of Mac OS X v10.6, this key’s value in a configuration file conveys a default value, which is changed with the [-w] option of the launchctl(1) load and unload subcommands. These subcommands no longer modify the configuration file, so the value displayed in the configuration file is not necessarily the value that launchctl(1) will apply. See launchctl(1) for more information.

    Please also be mindful that you should only use this key if the provided on-demand and KeepAlive criteria are insufficient to describe the conditions under which your job needs to run. The cost to have a job loaded in launchd is negligible, so there is no harm in loading a job which only runs once or very rarely.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.EnableGlobbing

    This flag causes launchd to use the glob(3) mechanism to update the program arguments before invocation.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.EnableTransactions

    This flag instructs launchd that the job promises to use vproc_transaction_begin(3) and vproc_transaction_end(3) to track outstanding transactions that need to be reconciled before the process can safely terminate. If no outstanding transactions are in progress, then launchd is free to send the SIGKILL signal.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.EnvironmentVariables

    This optional key is used to specify additional environment variables to be set before running the job.

    Type: null or (attribute set of string)

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.ExitTimeOut

    The amount of time launchd waits before sending a SIGKILL signal. The default value is 20 seconds. The value zero is interpreted as infinity.

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.GroupName

    This optional key specifies the group to run the job as. This key is only applicable when launchd is running as root. If UserName is set and GroupName is not, the the group will be set to the default group of the user.

    Type: null or string

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.HardResourceLimits

    Resource limits to be imposed on the job. These adjust variables set with setrlimit(2). The following keys apply:

    The maximum size (in bytes) which a process may lock into memory using the mlock(2) function.

    Type: null or signed integer

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.HardResourceLimits.NumberOfFiles

    The maximum number of open files for this process. Setting this value in a system wide daemon will set the sysctl(3) kern.maxfiles (SoftResourceLimits) or kern.maxfilesperproc (HardResourceLimits) value in addition to the setrlimit(2) values.

    Type: null or signed integer

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.HardResourceLimits.NumberOfProcesses

    The maximum number of simultaneous processes for this user id. Setting this value in a system wide daemon will set the sysctl(3) kern.maxproc (SoftResourceLimits) or kern.maxprocperuid (HardResourceLimits) value in addition to the setrlimit(2) values.

    Type: null or signed integer

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.HardResourceLimits.ResidentSetSize

    The maximum size (in bytes) to which a process’s resident set size may grow. This imposes a limit on the amount of physical memory to be given to a process; if memory is tight, the system will prefer to take memory from processes that are exceeding their declared resident set size.

    Type: null or signed integer

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.HardResourceLimits.Stack

    Type: null or signed integer

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.InitGroups

    This optional key specifies whether initgroups(3) should be called before running the job. The default is true in 10.5 and false in 10.4. This key will be ignored if the UserName key is not set.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.KeepAlive

    This optional key is used to control whether your job is to be kept continuously running or to let demand and conditions control the invocation. The default is false and therefore only demand will start the job. The value may be set to true to unconditionally keep the job alive. Alternatively, a dictionary of conditions may be specified to selectively control whether launchd keeps a job alive or not. If multiple keys are provided, launchd ORs them, thus providing maximum flexibility to the job to refine the logic and stall if necessary. If launchd finds no reason to restart the job, it falls back on demand based invocation. Jobs that exit quickly and frequently when configured to be kept alive will be throttled to converve system resources.

    Type: null or boolean or (submodule)

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Label

    This required key uniquely identifies the job to launchd.

    Type: string

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.LaunchEvents

    Specifies higher-level event types to be used as launch-on-demand event sources. Each sub-dictionary defines events for a particular event subsystem, such as “com.apple.iokit.matching”, which can be used to launch jobs based on the appearance of nodes in the IORegistry. Each dictionary within the sub-dictionary specifies an event descriptor that is specified to each event subsystem. With this key, the job promises to use the xpc_set_event_stream_handler(3) API to consume events. See xpc_events(3) for more details on event sources.

    Type: null or (attribute set)

    Default: null

    Example:

    {
      "com.apple.iokit.matching" = {
        "com.apple.usb.device" = {
          IOMatchLaunchStream = true;

    }

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.LaunchOnlyOnce

    This optional key specifies whether the job can only be run once and only once. In other words, if the job cannot be safely respawned without a full machine reboot, then set this key to be true.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.LimitLoadFromHosts

    This configuration file only applies to hosts NOT listed with this key. Note: One should set kern.hostname in sysctl.conf(5) for this feature to work reliably.

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.MachServices

    This optional key is used to specify Mach services to be registered with the Mach bootstrap sub-system. Each key in this dictionary should be the name of service to be advertised. The value of the key must be a boolean and set to true. Alternatively, a dictionary can be used instead of a simple true value.

    Finally, for the job itself, the values will be replaced with Mach ports at the time of check-in with launchd.

    Type: null or (attribute set of (boolean or (submodule)))

    Default: null

    This key was used in Mac OS X 10.4 to control whether a job was kept alive or not. The default was true. This key has been deprecated and replaced in Mac OS X 10.5 and later with the more powerful KeepAlive option.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.ProcessType

    This optional key describes, at a high level, the intended purpose of the job. The system will apply resource limits based on what kind of job it is. If left unspecified, the system will apply light resource limits to the job, throttling its CPU usage and I/O bandwidth. The following are valid values:

    Background

        Background jobs are generally processes that do work that was not directly requested by the user. The resource limits applied to Background jobs are intended to prevent them from disrupting the user experience.
    Standard

        Standard jobs are equivalent to no ProcessType being set.
    Adaptive

        Adaptive jobs move between the Background and Interactive classifications based on activity over XPC connections. See xpc_transaction_begin(3) for details.
    Interactive

        Interactive jobs run with the same resource limitations as apps, that is to say, none. Interactive jobs are critical to maintaining a responsive user experience, and this key should only be used if an app’s ability to be responsive depends on it, and cannot be made Adaptive.

    Type: null or one of “Background”, “Standard”, “Adaptive”, “Interactive”

    Default: null

    Example: "Background"

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Program

    This key maps to the first argument of execvp(3). If this key is missing, then the first element of the array of strings provided to the ProgramArguments will be used instead. This key is required in the absence of the ProgramArguments key.

    Type: null or absolute path

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.ProgramArguments

    Type: null or (list of string)

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.QueueDirectories

    Much like the WatchPaths option, this key will watch the paths for modifications. The difference being that the job will only be started if the path is a directory and the directory is not empty.

    Type: null or (list of string)

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.RootDirectory

    This optional key is used to specify a directory to chroot(2) to before running the job.

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.ServiceIPC

    This optional key specifies whether the job participates in advanced communication with launchd. The default is false. This flag is incompatible with the inetdCompatibility key.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.SessionCreate

    This key specifies that the job should be spawned into a new security audit session rather than the default session for the context is belongs to. See auditon(2) for details.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Sockets

    This optional key is used to specify launch on demand sockets that can be used to let launchd know when to run the job. The job must check-in to get a copy of the file descriptors using APIs outlined in launch(3). The keys of the top level Sockets dictionary can be anything. They are meant for the application developer to use to differentiate which descriptors correspond to which application level protocols (e.g. http vs. ftp vs. DNS…). At check-in time, the value of each Sockets dictionary key will be an array of descriptors. Daemon/Agent writers should consider all descriptors of a given key to be to be effectively equivalent, even though each file descriptor likely represents a different networking protocol which conforms to the criteria specified in the job configuration file.

    The parameters below are used as inputs to call getaddrinfo(3).

    Type: null or (attribute set of (submodule))

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Sockets.<name>.Bonjour

    This optional key can be used to request that the service be registered with the mDNSResponder(8). If the value is boolean, the service name is inferred from the SockServiceName.

    Type: null or boolean or list of string

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Sockets.<name>.MulticastGroup

    This optional key can be used to request that the datagram socket join a multicast group. If the value is a hostname, then getaddrinfo(3) will be used to join the correct multicast address for a given socket family. If an explicit IPv4 or IPv6 address is given, it is required that the SockFamily family also be set, otherwise the results are undefined.

    Type: null or string

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Sockets.<name>.SecureSocketWithKey

    This optional key is a variant of SockPathName. Instead of binding to a known path, a securely generated socket is created and the path is assigned to the environment variable that is inherited by all jobs spawned by launchd.

    Type: null or string

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Sockets.<name>.SockFamily

    This optional key can be used to specifically request that “IPv4” or “IPv6” socket(s) be created.

    Type: null or one of “IPv4”, “IPv6”

    Default: null

    Declared by:

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Sockets.<name>.SockPathName

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.SoftResourceLimits.NumberOfProcesses

    The maximum number of simultaneous processes for this user id. Setting this value in a system wide daemon will set the sysctl(3) kern.maxproc (SoftResourceLimits) or kern.maxprocperuid (HardResourceLimits) value in addition to the setrlimit(2) values.

    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.SoftResourceLimits.ResidentSetSize

    The maximum size (in bytes) to which a process’s resident set size may grow. This imposes a limit on the amount of physical memory to be given to a process; if memory is tight, the system will prefer to take memory from processes that are exceeding their declared resident set size.

    Type: null or signed integer

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.SoftResourceLimits.Stack

    The maximum size (in bytes) of the stack segment for a process; this defines how far a program’s stack segment may be extended. Stack extension is performed automatically by the system.

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.StartCalendarInterval

    This optional key causes the job to be started every calendar interval as specified. The semantics are much like crontab(5): Missing attributes are considered to be wildcard. Unlike cron which skips job invocations when the computer is asleep, launchd will start the job the next time the computer wakes up. If multiple intervals transpire before the computer is woken, those events will be coalesced into one event upon waking from sleep.
    Important

    The list must not be empty and must not contain duplicate entries (attrsets which compare equally).
    Caution

    Since missing attrs become wildcards, an empty attrset effectively means “every minute”.

    Type: null or (submodule) or unique (non-empty (list of (submodule)))

    Default: null

    Example:

    [

    ]

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.StartInterval

    Type: null or signed integer

    Default: null

    Declared by:

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.StartOnMount

    This optional key causes the job to be started every time a filesystem is mounted.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.ThrottleInterval

    This key lets one override the default throttling policy imposed on jobs by launchd. The value is in seconds, and by default, jobs will not be spawned more than once every 10 seconds. The principle behind this is that jobs should linger around just in case they are needed again in the near future. This not only reduces the latency of responses, but it encourages developers to amortize the cost of program invocation.

    Type: null or signed integer

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.TimeOut

    The recommended idle time out (in seconds) to pass to the job. If no value is specified, a default time out will be supplied by launchd for use by the job at check in time.

    Type: null or signed integer

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Umask

    Default: null

    Declared by:

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.WaitForDebugger

    This optional key specifies that launchd should instruct the kernel to have the job wait for a debugger to attach before any code in the job is executed.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.WatchPaths

    Type: null or string

    Default: null

    Declared by:

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.inetdCompatibility

    The presence of this key specifies that the daemon expects to be run as if it were launched from inetd.

    Example:

    {
      Wait = true;
    }

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.inetdCompatibility.Wait

    This flag corresponds to the “wait” or “nowait” option of inetd. If true, then the listening socket is passed via the standard in/out/error file descriptors. If false, then accept(2) is called on behalf of the job, and the result is passed via the standard in/out/error descriptors.

    Type: null or boolean or string

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons

    Definition of launchd daemons.

    After the system is booted and the kernel is running, launchd is run to finish the system initialization. As part of that initialization, it goes through the following steps:

        It loads the parameters for each launch-on-demand system-level daemon from the property list files found in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ and /Library/LaunchDaemons/.

        It registers the sockets and file descriptors requested by those daemons.

        It launches any daemons that requested to be running all the time.

        As requests for a particular service arrive, it launches the corresponding daemon and passes the request to it.

        When the system shuts down, it sends a SIGTERM signal to all of the daemons that it started.

    Type: attribute set of (submodule)

    Default: { }

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.command

    Command executed as the service’s main process.

    Type: string or absolute path

    Default: ""

    Declared by:

launchd.daemons.<name>.environment

    Environment variables passed to the service’s processes.

      LANG = "nl_NL.UTF-8";
      PATH = "/foo/bar/bin";
    }

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.path

    Packages added to the service’s PATH environment variable. Only the bin and subdirectories of each package is added.

    Type: list of (absolute path or string)

    Default: [ ]

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.script

    Shell commands executed as the service’s main process.

    Type: strings concatenated with “\n”

    Default: ""

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig

    Each attribute in this set specifies an option for a key in the plist. https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/launchd.plist.5.html

    Type: submodule

    Default: { }

    Example:

    {
      KeepAlive = true;
      Program = "/run/current-system/sw/bin/nix-daemon";
    }

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.AbandonProcessGroup

    When a job dies, launchd kills any remaining processes with the same process group ID as the job. Setting this key to true disables that behavior.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.Debug

    This optional key specifies that launchd should adjust its log mask temporarily to LOG_DEBUG while dealing with this job.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.Disabled

    This optional key is used as a hint to launchctl(1) that it should not submit this job to launchd when loading a job or jobs. The value of this key does NOT reflect the current state of the job on the running system. If you wish to know whether a job is loaded in launchd, reading this key from a configuration file yourself is not a sufficient test. You should query launchd for the presence of the job using the launchctl(1) list subcommand or use the ServiceManagement framework’s SMJobCopyDictionary() method.

    Note that as of Mac OS X v10.6, this key’s value in a configuration file conveys a default value, which is changed with the [-w] option of the launchctl(1) load and unload subcommands. These subcommands no longer modify the configuration file, so the value displayed in the configuration file is not necessarily the value that launchctl(1) will apply. See launchctl(1) for more information.

    Please also be mindful that you should only use this key if the provided on-demand and KeepAlive criteria are insufficient to describe the conditions under which your job needs to run. The cost to have a job loaded in launchd is negligible, so there is no harm in loading a job which only runs once or very rarely.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.EnableGlobbing

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.EnableTransactions

    This flag instructs launchd that the job promises to use vproc_transaction_begin(3) and vproc_transaction_end(3) to track outstanding transactions that need to be reconciled before the process can safely terminate. If no outstanding transactions are in progress, then launchd is free to send the SIGKILL signal.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.EnvironmentVariables

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.KeepAlive

    This optional key is used to control whether your job is to be kept continuously running or to let demand and conditions control the invocation. The default is false and therefore only demand will start the job. The value may be set to true to unconditionally keep the job alive. Alternatively, a dictionary of conditions may be specified to selectively control whether launchd keeps a job alive or not. If multiple keys are provided, launchd ORs them, thus providing maximum flexibility to the job to refine the logic and stall if necessary. If launchd finds no reason to restart the job, it falls back on demand based invocation. Jobs that exit quickly and frequently when configured to be kept alive will be throttled to converve system resources.

    Type: null or boolean or (submodule)

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.Label

    This required key uniquely identifies the job to launchd.

    Type: string

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.LaunchEvents

    Specifies higher-level event types to be used as launch-on-demand event sources. Each sub-dictionary defines events for a particular event subsystem, such as “com.apple.iokit.matching”, which can be used to launch jobs based on the appearance of nodes in the IORegistry. Each dictionary within the sub-dictionary specifies an event descriptor that is specified to each event subsystem. With this key, the job promises to use the xpc_set_event_stream_handler(3) API to consume events. See xpc_events(3) for more details on event sources.

    Type: null or (attribute set)

    Default: null

    Example:

    {
      "com.apple.iokit.matching" = {
        "com.apple.usb.device" = {
          IOMatchLaunchStream = true;
          IOProviderClass = "IOUSBDevice";
          idProduct = "*";

    }

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.LaunchOnlyOnce

    This optional key specifies whether the job can only be run once and only once. In other words, if the job cannot be safely respawned without a full machine reboot, then set this key to be true.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.LimitLoadFromHosts

    This configuration file only applies to hosts NOT listed with this key. Note: One should set kern.hostname in sysctl.conf(5) for this feature to work reliably.

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.MachServices

    This optional key is used to specify Mach services to be registered with the Mach bootstrap sub-system. Each key in this dictionary should be the name of service to be advertised. The value of the key must be a boolean and set to true. Alternatively, a dictionary can be used instead of a simple true value.

    Finally, for the job itself, the values will be replaced with Mach ports at the time of check-in with launchd.

    Type: null or (attribute set of (boolean or (submodule)))

    Default: null

    Example:

    {
      "org.nixos.service" = {
        ResetAtClose = true;
      };
    }

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.OnDemand

    This key was used in Mac OS X 10.4 to control whether a job was kept alive or not. The default was true. This key has been deprecated and replaced in Mac OS X 10.5 and later with the more powerful KeepAlive option.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.ProcessType

    This optional key describes, at a high level, the intended purpose of the job. The system will apply resource limits based on what kind of job it is. If left unspecified, the system will apply light resource limits to the job, throttling its CPU usage and I/O bandwidth. The following are valid values:

    Background

        Background jobs are generally processes that do work that was not directly requested by the user. The resource limits applied to Background jobs are intended to prevent them from disrupting the user experience.
    Standard

        Standard jobs are equivalent to no ProcessType being set.
    Adaptive

        Adaptive jobs move between the Background and Interactive classifications based on activity over XPC connections. See xpc_transaction_begin(3) for details.
    Interactive

        Interactive jobs run with the same resource limitations as apps, that is to say, none. Interactive jobs are critical to maintaining a responsive user experience, and this key should only be used if an app’s ability to be responsive depends on it, and cannot be made Adaptive.

    Type: null or one of “Background”, “Standard”, “Adaptive”, “Interactive”

    Default: null

    Example: "Background"

    Type: null or (list of string)

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.QueueDirectories

    Much like the WatchPaths option, this key will watch the paths for modifications. The difference being that the job will only be started if the path is a directory and the directory is not empty.

    Type: null or (list of string)

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.RootDirectory

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.SessionCreate

    This key specifies that the job should be spawned into a new security audit session rather than the default session for the context is belongs to. See auditon(2) for details.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.Sockets

    This optional key is used to specify launch on demand sockets that can be used to let launchd know when to run the job. The job must check-in to get a copy of the file descriptors using APIs outlined in launch(3). The keys of the top level Sockets dictionary can be anything. They are meant for the application developer to use to differentiate which descriptors correspond to which application level protocols (e.g. http vs. ftp vs. DNS…). At check-in time, the value of each Sockets dictionary key will be an array of descriptors. Daemon/Agent writers should consider all descriptors of a given key to be to be effectively equivalent, even though each file descriptor likely represents a different networking protocol which conforms to the criteria specified in the job configuration file.

    The parameters below are used as inputs to call getaddrinfo(3).

    Type: null or (attribute set of (submodule))

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.Sockets.<name>.Bonjour

    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.Sockets.<name>.MulticastGroup

    This optional key can be used to request that the datagram socket join a multicast group. If the value is a hostname, then getaddrinfo(3) will be used to join the correct multicast address for a given socket family. If an explicit IPv4 or IPv6 address is given, it is required that the SockFamily family also be set, otherwise the results are undefined.

    Type: null or string

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.Sockets.<name>.SecureSocketWithKey

    This optional key is a variant of SockPathName. Instead of binding to a known path, a securely generated socket is created and the path is assigned to the environment variable that is inherited by all jobs spawned by launchd.

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.Sockets.<name>.SockFamily

    Type: null or signed integer

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.SoftResourceLimits.Stack

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.StartCalendarInterval

    This optional key causes the job to be started every calendar interval as specified. The semantics are much like crontab(5): Missing attributes are considered to be wildcard. Unlike cron which skips job invocations when the computer is asleep, launchd will start the job the next time the computer wakes up. If multiple intervals transpire before the computer is woken, those events will be coalesced into one event upon waking from sleep.
    Important

    The list must not be empty and must not contain duplicate entries (attrsets which compare equally).
    Caution

    Since missing attrs become wildcards, an empty attrset effectively means “every minute”.

    Type: null or (submodule) or unique (non-empty (list of (submodule)))

    Default: null

    Example:

    [
      {

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.ThrottleInterval

    This key lets one override the default throttling policy imposed on jobs by launchd. The value is in seconds, and by default, jobs will not be spawned more than once every 10 seconds. The principle behind this is that jobs should linger around just in case they are needed again in the near future. This not only reduces the latency of responses, but it encourages developers to amortize the cost of program invocation.

    Type: null or signed integer

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.TimeOut

    The recommended idle time out (in seconds) to pass to the job. If no value is specified, a default time out will be supplied by launchd for use by the job at check in time.

    Type: null or signed integer

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.Umask

    This optional key specifies what value should be passed to umask(2) before running the job. Known bug: Property lists don’t support octal, so please convert the value to decimal.

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.WaitForDebugger

    This optional key specifies that launchd should instruct the kernel to have the job wait for a debugger to attach before any code in the job is executed.

    {
      Wait = true;
    }

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.daemons.<name>.serviceConfig.inetdCompatibility.Wait

    This flag corresponds to the “wait” or “nowait” option of inetd. If true, then the listening socket is passed via the standard in/out/error file descriptors. If false, then accept(2) is called on behalf of the job, and the result is passed via the standard in/out/error descriptors.

    Type: null or boolean or string

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.envVariables

    A set of environment variables to be set on all future processes launched by launchd in the caller’s context. The value of each variable can be either a string or a list of strings. The latter is concatenated, interspersed with colon characters.

    Type: attribute set of (string or list of string)

launchd.user.agents

    Definition of per-user launchd agents.

    When a user logs in, a per-user launchd is started. It does the following:

        It loads the parameters for each launch-on-demand user agent from the property list files found in /System/Library/LaunchAgents, /Library/LaunchAgents, and the user’s individual Library/LaunchAgents directory.

        It registers the sockets and file descriptors requested by those user agents.

        It launches any user agents that requested to be running all the time.

        As requests for a particular service arrive, it launches the corresponding user agent and passes the request to it.

        When the user logs out, it sends a SIGTERM signal to all of the user agents that it started.

    Type: attribute set of (submodule)

    Default: { }

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.AbandonProcessGroup

    When a job dies, launchd kills any remaining processes with the same process group ID as the job. Setting this key to true disables that behavior.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Debug

    This optional key specifies that launchd should adjust its log mask temporarily to LOG_DEBUG while dealing with this job.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Disabled

    This optional key is used as a hint to launchctl(1) that it should not submit this job to launchd when loading a job or jobs. The value of this key does NOT reflect the current state of the job on the running system. If you wish to know whether a job is loaded in launchd, reading this key from a configuration file yourself is not a sufficient test. You should query launchd for the presence of the job using the launchctl(1) list subcommand or use the ServiceManagement framework’s SMJobCopyDictionary() method.

    Note that as of Mac OS X v10.6, this key’s value in a configuration file conveys a default value, which is changed with the [-w] option of the launchctl(1) load and unload subcommands. These subcommands no longer modify the configuration file, so the value displayed in the configuration file is not necessarily the value that launchctl(1) will apply. See launchctl(1) for more information.

    Please also be mindful that you should only use this key if the provided on-demand and KeepAlive criteria are insufficient to describe the conditions under which your job needs to run. The cost to have a job loaded in launchd is negligible, so there is no harm in loading a job which only runs once or very rarely.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.EnableGlobbing

    This flag causes launchd to use the glob(3) mechanism to update the program arguments before invocation.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.EnableTransactions

    This flag instructs launchd that the job promises to use vproc_transaction_begin(3) and vproc_transaction_end(3) to track outstanding transactions that need to be reconciled before the process can safely terminate. If no outstanding transactions are in progress, then launchd is free to send the SIGKILL signal.

    Type: null or boolean

    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.HardResourceLimits.ResidentSetSize

    The maximum size (in bytes) to which a process’s resident set size may grow. This imposes a limit on the amount of physical memory to be given to a process; if memory is tight, the system will prefer to take memory from processes that are exceeding their declared resident set size.

    Type: null or signed integer

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.HardResourceLimits.Stack

    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.InitGroups

    This optional key specifies whether initgroups(3) should be called before running the job. The default is true in 10.5 and false in 10.4. This key will be ignored if the UserName key is not set.

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.KeepAlive

    This optional key is used to control whether your job is to be kept continuously running or to let demand and conditions control the invocation. The default is false and therefore only demand will start the job. The value may be set to true to unconditionally keep the job alive. Alternatively, a dictionary of conditions may be specified to selectively control whether launchd keeps a job alive or not. If multiple keys are provided, launchd ORs them, thus providing maximum flexibility to the job to refine the logic and stall if necessary. If launchd finds no reason to restart the job, it falls back on demand based invocation. Jobs that exit quickly and frequently when configured to be kept alive will be throttled to converve system resources.

    Type: null or boolean or (submodule)

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Label

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.LaunchEvents

    Specifies higher-level event types to be used as launch-on-demand event sources. Each sub-dictionary defines events for a particular event subsystem, such as “com.apple.iokit.matching”, which can be used to launch jobs based on the appearance of nodes in the IORegistry. Each dictionary within the sub-dictionary specifies an event descriptor that is specified to each event subsystem. With this key, the job promises to use the xpc_set_event_stream_handler(3) API to consume events. See xpc_events(3) for more details on event sources.

    Type: null or (attribute set)

    Default: null

    Example:

    {

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.MachServices

    This optional key is used to specify Mach services to be registered with the Mach bootstrap sub-system. Each key in this dictionary should be the name of service to be advertised. The value of the key must be a boolean and set to true. Alternatively, a dictionary can be used instead of a simple true value.

    Finally, for the job itself, the values will be replaced with Mach ports at the time of check-in with launchd.

    Type: null or (attribute set of (boolean or (submodule)))

    Default: null

    Example:

    {
      "org.nixos.service" = {
        ResetAtClose = true;

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.ProcessType

    This optional key describes, at a high level, the intended purpose of the job. The system will apply resource limits based on what kind of job it is. If left unspecified, the system will apply light resource limits to the job, throttling its CPU usage and I/O bandwidth. The following are valid values:

    Background

        Background jobs are generally processes that do work that was not directly requested by the user. The resource limits applied to Background jobs are intended to prevent them from disrupting the user experience.
    Standard

        Standard jobs are equivalent to no ProcessType being set.
    Adaptive

        Adaptive jobs move between the Background and Interactive classifications based on activity over XPC connections. See xpc_transaction_begin(3) for details.
    Interactive

        Interactive jobs run with the same resource limitations as apps, that is to say, none. Interactive jobs are critical to maintaining a responsive user experience, and this key should only be used if an app’s ability to be responsive depends on it, and cannot be made Adaptive.

    Type: null or one of “Background”, “Standard”, “Adaptive”, “Interactive”

    Default: null

    Example: "Background"

    Declared by:

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.QueueDirectories

    Much like the WatchPaths option, this key will watch the paths for modifications. The difference being that the job will only be started if the path is a directory and the directory is not empty.

    Type: null or (list of string)

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.RootDirectory

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.SessionCreate

    Type: null or boolean

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Sockets

    This optional key is used to specify launch on demand sockets that can be used to let launchd know when to run the job. The job must check-in to get a copy of the file descriptors using APIs outlined in launch(3). The keys of the top level Sockets dictionary can be anything. They are meant for the application developer to use to differentiate which descriptors correspond to which application level protocols (e.g. http vs. ftp vs. DNS…). At check-in time, the value of each Sockets dictionary key will be an array of descriptors. Daemon/Agent writers should consider all descriptors of a given key to be to be effectively equivalent, even though each file descriptor likely represents a different networking protocol which conforms to the criteria specified in the job configuration file.

    The parameters below are used as inputs to call getaddrinfo(3).

    Type: null or (attribute set of (submodule))

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Sockets.<name>.Bonjour

    This optional key can be used to request that the service be registered with the mDNSResponder(8). If the value is boolean, the service name is inferred from the SockServiceName.

    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Sockets.<name>.MulticastGroup

    This optional key can be used to request that the datagram socket join a multicast group. If the value is a hostname, then getaddrinfo(3) will be used to join the correct multicast address for a given socket family. If an explicit IPv4 or IPv6 address is given, it is required that the SockFamily family also be set, otherwise the results are undefined.

    Type: null or string

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Sockets.<name>.SecureSocketWithKey

    This optional key is a variant of SockPathName. Instead of binding to a known path, a securely generated socket is created and the path is assigned to the environment variable that is inherited by all jobs spawned by launchd.

    Type: null or string

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.Sockets.<name>.SockFamily

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.StartCalendarInterval

    This optional key causes the job to be started every calendar interval as specified. The semantics are much like crontab(5): Missing attributes are considered to be wildcard. Unlike cron which skips job invocations when the computer is asleep, launchd will start the job the next time the computer wakes up. If multiple intervals transpire before the computer is woken, those events will be coalesced into one event upon waking from sleep.
    Important

    The list must not be empty and must not contain duplicate entries (attrsets which compare equally).
    Caution

    Since missing attrs become wildcards, an empty attrset effectively means “every minute”.

    Type: null or (submodule) or unique (non-empty (list of (submodule)))

    Default: null

    Example:

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.ThrottleInterval

    This key lets one override the default throttling policy imposed on jobs by launchd. The value is in seconds, and by default, jobs will not be spawned more than once every 10 seconds. The principle behind this is that jobs should linger around just in case they are needed again in the near future. This not only reduces the latency of responses, but it encourages developers to amortize the cost of program invocation.

    Type: null or signed integer

    Default: null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/launchd>

launchd.user.agents.<name>.serviceConfig.TimeOut

networking.localHostName

    The local hostname, or local network name, is displayed beneath the computer’s name at the top of the Sharing preferences pane. It identifies your Mac to Bonjour-compatible services.

    Setting this option is equivalent to running the command scutil --set LocalHostName, where running, e.g., scutil --set LocalHostName 'Johns-MacBook-Pro', would set the systems local hostname to “Johns-MacBook-Pro.local”. The value of this option defaults to the value of the networking.hostName option.

    By default on macOS the local hostname is your computer’s name with “.local” appended, with any spaces replaced with hyphens, and invalid characters omitted.

    Configuration for Nix, see https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#sec-conf-file for avalaible options. The value declared here will be translated directly to the key-value pairs Nix expects.

    Nix configurations defined under nix.* will be translated and applied to this option. In addition, configuration specified in nix.extraOptions which will be appended verbatim to the resulting config file.

    Type: open submodule of attribute set of (Nix config atom (null, bool, int, float, str, path or package) or list of (Nix config atom (null, bool, int, float, str, path or package)))

    Default: { }

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix>

nix.settings.allowed-users

    A list of names of users (separated by whitespace) that are allowed to connect to the Nix daemon. As with nix.settings.trusted-users, you can specify groups by prefixing them with @. Also, you can allow all users by specifying *. The default is *. Note that trusted users are always allowed to connect.

    Type: list of string

    Default:

      "*"
    ]

    Example:

    [
      "@admin"
      "@builders"
      "alice"
      "bob"
    ]

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix>

nix.settings.auto-optimise-store

    If set to true, Nix automatically detects files in the store that have identical contents, and replaces them with hard links to a single copy. This saves disk space. If set to false (the default), you can enable nix.optimise.automatic to run nix-store --optimise periodically to get rid of duplicate files. You can also run nix-store --optimise manually.

    Type: boolean

    Default: false

    Example: true

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix>

nix.settings.cores

    This option defines the maximum number of concurrent tasks during one build. It affects, e.g., -j option for make. The special value 0 means that the builder should use all available CPU cores in the system. Some builds may become non-deterministic with this option; use with care! Packages will only be affected if enableParallelBuilding is set for them.

    Type: signed integer

    Default: 0

    Example: 64

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix>

nix.settings.extra-sandbox-paths

    Directories from the host filesystem to be included in the sandbox.

    Type: list of string

    Default: [ ]

    Example:

    [
      "/dev"
      "/proc"
    ]

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix>

nix.settings.max-jobs

    This option defines the maximum number of jobs that Nix will try to build in parallel. The default is auto, which means it will use all available logical cores. It is recommend to set it to the total number of logical cores in your system (e.g., 16 for two CPUs with 4 cores each and hyper-threading).

    Type: signed integer or value “auto” (singular enum)

    Default: "auto"

    Example: 64

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix>

nix.settings.require-sigs

    If enabled (the default), Nix will only download binaries from binary caches if they are cryptographically signed with any of the keys listed in nix.settings.trusted-public-keys. If disabled, signatures are neither required nor checked, so it’s strongly recommended that you use only trustworthy caches and https to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

    Type: boolean

    Default: true

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix>

nix.settings.sandbox

    If set, Nix will perform builds in a sandboxed environment that it will set up automatically for each build. This prevents impurities in builds by disallowing access to dependencies outside of the Nix store by using network and mount namespaces in a chroot environment. It doesn’t affect derivation hashes, so changing this option will not trigger a rebuild of packages.

    Type: boolean or value “relaxed” (singular enum)

    Default: false

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix>

nix.settings.substituters

    List of binary cache URLs used to obtain pre-built binaries of Nix packages.

    By default https://cache.nixos.org/ is added.

    Type: list of string

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix>

nix.settings.trusted-public-keys

    List of public keys used to sign binary caches. If nix.settings.trusted-public-keys is enabled, then Nix will use a binary from a binary cache if and only if it is signed by any of the keys listed here. By default, only the key for cache.nixos.org is included.

    Type: list of string

    Example:

    [
      "hydra.nixos.org-1:CNHJZBh9K4tP3EKF6FkkgeVYsS3ohTl+oS0Qa8bezVs="
    ]

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix>

nix.settings.trusted-substituters

    List of binary cache URLs that non-root users can use (in addition to those specified using nix.settings.substituters) by passing --option binary-caches to Nix commands.

    Type: list of string

    Default: [ ]

    Example:

    [
      "https://hydra.nixos.org/"
    ]

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix>

nix.settings.trusted-users

    A list of names of users that have additional rights when connecting to the Nix daemon, such as the ability to specify additional binary caches, or to import unsigned NARs. You can also specify groups by prefixing them with @; for instance, @admin means all users in the wheel group.

    Type: list of string

    Example:

    [
      "root"
      "alice"
      "@admin"
    ]

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix>

nixpkgs.buildPlatform

    Specifies the platform on which nix-darwin should be built. By default, nix-darwin is built on the system where it runs, but you can change where it’s built. Setting this option will cause nix-darwin to be cross-compiled.

    For instance, if you’re doing distributed multi-platform deployment, or if you’re building machines, you can set this to match your development system and/or build farm.

    Ignored when nixpkgs.pkgs is set.

    Type: string or (attribute set)

    Default: config.nixpkgs.hostPlatform

    Example:

    {
      system = "x86_64-darwin";
    }

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix/nixpkgs.nix>

nixpkgs.config

    Global configuration for Nixpkgs. The complete list of Nixpkgs configuration options is in the Nixpkgs manual section on global configuration.

    Ignored when nixpkgs.pkgs is set.

    Type: nixpkgs config

    Default: { }

    Example:

    { allowBroken = true; allowUnfree = true; }

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix/nixpkgs.nix>

nixpkgs.flake.setFlakeRegistry

    Whether to pin nixpkgs in the system-wide flake registry (/etc/nix/registry.json) to the store path of the sources of nixpkgs used to build the nix-darwin system.

    This is on by default for nix-darwin configurations built with flakes.

    This option makes nix run nixpkgs#hello reuse dependencies from the system, avoid refetching nixpkgs, and have a consistent result every time.

    Note that this option makes the nix-darwin closure depend on the nixpkgs sources, which may add undesired closure size if the system will not have any nix commands run on it.

    Type: boolean

    Default: config.nix.enable && config.nixpkgs.flake.source != null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix/nixpkgs-flake.nix>

nixpkgs.flake.setNixPath

    Whether to set NIX_PATH to include nixpkgs=flake:nixpkgs such that <nixpkgs> lookups receive the version of nixpkgs that the system was built with, in concert with nixpkgs.flake.setFlakeRegistry.

    This is on by default for nix-darwin configurations built with flakes.

    This makes nix-build '<nixpkgs>' -A hello work out of the box on flake systems.

    Note that this option makes the nix-darwin closure depend on the nixpkgs sources, which may add undesired closure size if the system will not have any nix commands run on it.

    Type: boolean

    Default: config.nix.enable && nixpkgs.flake.source != null

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix/nixpkgs-flake.nix>

nixpkgs.flake.source

    The path to the nixpkgs sources used to build the system. This is automatically set up to be the store path of the nixpkgs flake used to build the system if using nixpkgs.lib.darwinSystem, and is otherwise null by default.

    This can also be optionally set if the nix-darwin system is not built with a flake but still uses pinned sources: set this to the store path for the nixpkgs sources used to build the system, as may be obtained by builtins.fetchTarball, for example.

    Note: the name of the store path must be “source” due to https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/7075.

    Type: null or string or absolute path

    Default: "if (using nix-darwin.lib.darwinSystem) then nixpkgs.source else null"

    Example: "builtins.fetchTarball { name = \"source\"; sha256 = \"sha256-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=\"; url = \"https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/archive/somecommit.tar.gz\"; }"

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix/nixpkgs-flake.nix>

nixpkgs.hostPlatform

    Specifies the platform where the nix-darwin configuration will run.

    To cross-compile, set also nixpkgs.buildPlatform.

    Ignored when nixpkgs.pkgs is set.

    Type: string or (attribute set)

    Example:

    {
      system = "aarch64-darwin";
    }

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix/nixpkgs.nix>

nixpkgs.overlays

    List of overlays to apply to Nixpkgs. This option allows modifying the Nixpkgs package set accessed through the pkgs module argument.

    For details, see the Overlays chapter in the Nixpkgs manual.

    If the nixpkgs.pkgs option is set, overlays specified using nixpkgs.overlays will be applied after the overlays that were already included in nixpkgs.pkgs.

    Type: list of (nixpkgs overlay)

    Default: [ ]

    Example:

    [
      (self: super: {
        openssh = super.openssh.override {
          hpnSupport = true;
          kerberos = self.libkrb5;
        };
      })
    ]

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix/nixpkgs.nix>

nixpkgs.pkgs

    If set, the pkgs argument to all nix-darwin modules is the value of this option, extended with nixpkgs.overlays, if that is also set. The nix-darwin and Nixpkgs architectures must match. Any other options in nixpkgs.*, notably config, will be ignored.

    The default value imports the Nixpkgs from nixpkgs.source. The config, overlays, localSystem, and crossSystem are based on this option’s siblings.

    This option can be used to increase the performance of evaluation, or to create packages that depend on a container that should be built with the exact same evaluation of Nixpkgs, for example. Applications like this should set their default value using lib.mkDefault, so user-provided configuration can override it without using lib.

    Type: An evaluation of Nixpkgs; the top level attribute set of packages

    Example: import <nixpkgs> {}

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix/nixpkgs.nix>

nixpkgs.source

    The path to import Nixpkgs from. If you’re setting a custom nixpkgs.pkgs or _module.args.pkgs, setting this to something with rev and shortRev attributes (such as a flake input or builtins.fetchGit result) will also set system.nixpkgsRevision and related options. (nix-darwin only)

    Type: absolute path

    Default: <nixpkgs> or nix-darwin’s nixpkgs flake input

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix/nixpkgs.nix>

nixpkgs.system

    Specifies the Nix platform type on which nix-darwin should be built. It is better to specify nixpkgs.hostPlatform instead.

    Ignored when nixpkgs.pkgs or nixpkgs.hostPlatform is set.

    Type: string

    Default: Traditionally builtins.currentSystem, but unset when invoking nix-darwin through lib.darwinSystem.

    Example: "x86_64-darwin"

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/nix/nixpkgs.nix>

services.github-runners

    Multiple GitHub Runners.

    If user and group are set to null, the module will configure nix-darwin to manage the _github-runner user and group. Note that multiple runner configurations share the same user/group, which means they can access resources from other runners. Make each runner use its own user and group if this is not what you want. In this case, you will have to do the user and group creation yourself. If only user is set, while group is set to null, the service will infer the primary group of the user.

    For each GitHub runner, the system activation script creates the following directories:

        /var/lib/github-runners/<name>: State directory to store the runner registration credentials

        /var/lib/github-runners/_work/<name>: Working directory for workflow files. The runner only uses this directory if workDir is null (see the workDir option for details).

        /var/log/github-runners/<name>: The launchd service writes the stdout and stderr streams to this directory.

    Type: attribute set of (submodule)

    Default: { }

    Example:

    {
      runner1 = {
        enable = true;
        name = "runner1";
        tokenFile = "/secrets/token1";
        url = "https://github.com/owner/repo";

        Passes the --ephemeral flag to the runner configuration script

        De-registers and stops the runner with GitHub after it has processed one job

        Restarts the service after its successful exit

        On start, wipes the state directory and configures a new runner

    You should only enable this option if tokenFile points to a file which contains a personal access token (PAT). If you’re using the option with a registration token, restarting the service will fail as soon as the registration token expired.

    Changing this option triggers a new runner registration.

services.github-runners.<name>.tokenFile

    The full path to a file which contains either

        a fine-grained personal access token (PAT),

        a classic PAT

        or a runner registration token

    Changing this option or the tokenFile’s content triggers a new runner registration.

    You can also manually trigger a new runner registration by deleting /var/lib/github-runners/<name>/.runner and restarting the service.

    We suggest using the fine-grained PATs. A runner registration token is valid only for 1 hour after creation, so the next time the runner configuration changes this will give you hard-to-debug HTTP 404 errors in the configure step.

    The file should contain exactly one line with the token without any newline. (Use echo -n '…token…' > …token file… to make sure no newlines sneak in.)

    If the file contains a PAT, the service creates a new registration token on startup as needed. If a registration token is given, it can be used to re-register a runner of the same name but is time-limited as noted above.

    For fine-grained PATs:

    Give it “Read and Write access to organization/repository self hosted runners”, depending on whether it is organization wide or per-repository. You might have to experiment a little, fine-grained PATs are a beta Github feature and still subject to change; nonetheless they are the best option at the moment.

    For classic PATs:

    Make sure the PAT has a scope of admin:org for organization-wide registrations or a scope of repo for a single repository.

    For runner registration tokens:

    Nothing special needs to be done, but updating will break after one hour, so these are not recommended.

    Type: absolute path

    Example: "/run/secrets/github-runner/nixos.token"

    Declared by:
    <nix-darwin/modules/services/github-runner/options.nix>

services.github-runners.<name>.url

    Repository to add the runner to.

    Changing this option triggers a new runner registration.

    IMPORTANT: If your token is org-wide (not per repository), you need to provide a github org link, not a single repository, so do it like this https://github.com/nixos, not like this https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs. Otherwise, you are going to get a 404 NotFound from POST https://api.github.com/actions/runner-registration in the configure script.

services.hercules-ci-agent.settings.concurrentTasks

    Number of tasks to perform simultaneously.

    A task is a single derivation build, an evaluation or an effect run. At minimum, you need 2 concurrent tasks for x86_64-linux in your cluster, to allow for import from derivation.

    concurrentTasks can be around the CPU core count or lower if memory is the bottleneck.

    The optimal value depends on the resource consumption characteristics of your workload, including memory usage and in-task parallelism. This is typically determined empirically.

    When scaling, it is generally better to have a double-size machine than two machines, because each split of resources causes inefficiencies; particularly with regards to build latency because of extra downloads.

system.stateVersion

    Every once in a while, a new nix-darwin release may change configuration defaults in a way incompatible with stateful data. For instance, if the default version of PostgreSQL changes, the new version will probably be unable to read your existing databases. To prevent such breakage, you can set the value of this option to the nix-darwin release with which you want to be compatible. The effect is that nix-darwin will option defaults corresponding to the specified release (such as using an older version of PostgreSQL).
